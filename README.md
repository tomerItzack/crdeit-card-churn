Hello everyone! Welcome to the Customer Retirement Data Analysis project.

## Project Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset reflecting the data of retiring customers. The analysis was performed using Python, and the results were compiled into a CANVA presentation for easy visualization and interpretation.

## Business Questions
The analysis aims to answer the following business questions:
1. Is there a correlation between the type of credit card and the tendency of customers to leave?
2. What are the primary reasons cited for retirement?
3. What is the profile of the most loyal customer in the company?

## Dataset
You can find the dataset on Kaggle: [Credit Card Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers)

## Prerequisites
